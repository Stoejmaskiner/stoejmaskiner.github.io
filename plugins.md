Nothing here yet... We are working hard on our first plugin, and it's going to be free!

What is it? It's a simple analog-modelled synth with a few tricks up its sleeve. But you'll have to wait to know more details...

In the meantime, check out our free [legacy plugins](/archive/legacy-plugins/), which are made in Rust and are organic🌿 (for legal reasons I have to say that this is a joke).
