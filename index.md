## Useful Discrete No-Filler Sample Packs

Tired of having to use sample packs that are ridiculously over-produced, have no dynamic range, and only contain a couple usable samples in the entire pack? Then congratulations, you've come to the right place!

Our sample packs are affordable ([some are even free!](TODO)), have no filler, are discrete (as in not overly processed) so they fit in any mix, without taking all the attention; so you can speed up your production, without compromising your personal style with somebody else's overbearing sound design decisions.

Sounds interesting? [Check them out over here!](TODO)

## Creative Plugins to Spice Up Your Production
We make plugins too (VST3, AU, RTAS and AAX). Most of them are simple tools with a very focussed function, with some added idiosyncracies to add some spice and unusual flavour to your productions.

Workflow is a central focus of our plugins, as such the interface is structured around layers of complexity, the front-most layer exposes only the most important functions and hosts a few user-configurable macros, but an extended set of parameters is available in the deeper layers.

[Take me to the plugins!](TODO)

## Oh Yeah, We Also Have a Blog
Mostly just a place to collect some of the ramblings of the curator of this site. Mostly deep-dives into oddly specific music-related topics.

If that's your thing, [Check 'em out over here](TODO)
